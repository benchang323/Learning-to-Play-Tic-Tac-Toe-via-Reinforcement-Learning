# Learning-to-Play-Tic-Tac-Toe-via-Reinforcement-Learning
## Repository Description
This repository contains the code for the research paper, "Learning to Play Tic Tac Toe via Reinforcement Learning," which has been published as a pre-print on TechRxiv and is currently under review for publication in a peer-reviewed academic journal. The paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to teaching an artificial intelligence agent to play the game of Tic Tac Toe.

## Abstract
Machine learning algorithms are implemented in a wide variety of modern applications to train computers to make efficient predictions and decisions based on their observations of past data. Reinforcement learning is a paradigm of machine learning that is concerned with making the most beneficial decision in a particular environment in order to maximize the reward. I The Q-learning algorithm is a reinforcement learning algorithm that solves decision-making problems by assigning different scores to different decisions at each state of the problem. When applied to learn to play a game such as Tic-Tac-Toe, at each board position, the goal of the algorithm is to assign a numerical score to each move, where the score is proportional to the chance of winning. This trains the machine to perform the most beneficial moves by simultaneously exploiting already learned beneficial information and exploring its possibilities by constantly trying out new game moves.

Using numerically mapping algorithms of Q-Learning to predict a gameâ€™s outcome through iterative training, we have trained an artificial Tic-Tac-Toe opponent to refer to Q values for all possible player decisions in a current environment and chose the one with the highest value. With the example of Tic-Tac-Toe, we examine how reinforcement learning allows machines to implement dynamic programming techniques to maximize their performance with minimal human intervention and assistance.
